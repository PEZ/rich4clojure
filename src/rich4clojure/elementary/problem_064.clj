;; Reduce takes a 2 argument function and an optional
;; starting value. It then applies the function to the
;; first 2 items in the sequence (or the starting value
;; and the first element of the sequence). In the next
;; iteration the function will be called on the previous
;; return value and the next item from the sequence, thus
;; reducing the entire collection to one value. Don't
;; worry, it's not as complicated as it sounds.
