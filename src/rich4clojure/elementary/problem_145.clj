;; Clojure's for macro is a tremendously versatile
;; mechanism for producing a sequence based on some other
;; sequence(s). It can take some time to understand how to
;; use it properly, but that investment will be paid back
;; with clear, concise sequence-wrangling later. With that
;; in mind, read over these for expressions and try to see
;; how each of them produces the same result.
