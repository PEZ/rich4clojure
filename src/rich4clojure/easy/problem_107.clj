;; 
;; Lexical scope and first-class functions are two of the
;; most basic building blocks of a functional language
;; like Clojure. When you combine the two together, you
;; get something very powerful called lexical closures.
;; With these, you can exercise a great deal of control
;; over the lifetime of your local bindings, saving their
;; values for use later, long after the code you're
;; running now has finished.
;; 
;; 
;; It can be hard to follow in the abstract, so let's
;; build a simple closure. Given a positive integer n,
;; return a function (f x) which computes x n. Observe
;; that the effect of this is to preserve the value of n
;; for use outside the scope in which it is defined.
